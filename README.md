Weather iOS Application

This app allows you to see the weather for any zip code you enter. It shows the current tempature, a description of the current conditions, humidity, high and lows, wind speed, and wind direction. It also displays the city and state. When you first enter in a zip code it checks an API to see if the zip code exists. If the zip code doesn't exist it gives you an error and asks you to reenter the zip code. If it does exist it uses an API to get the current weather data and updates the weather screen.
